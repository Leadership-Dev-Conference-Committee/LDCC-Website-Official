# LDCC-Website-Official
 
The Leadership Development Conference (LDC) website is a platform for students to learn about the annual engineering LDC. In collaboration with the McMaster Engineering Society (MES), our goal is to raise awarness and attract more attention. 
LDC is a chance for students to network with Alumni, peers, and working professional.
